Solution to the problems of week zero on Cs50 Artificial Intelligence

In addition to my basic article about searching algorithms on medium.com, I want to share my solutions to the problems named degree and tic-tac-to.
It consists of pseudocode and the codes of solutions.

While degrees just contains Breadth-First Search algorithm, tic-tac-toe includes Minimax algorithm.
You can try the Depth-First Search alogirthm by changing the queue to stack and add alpha prunning method to the tic-tac-toe solution.
